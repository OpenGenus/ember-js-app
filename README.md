# Ember-JS

Ember JS is an open-source JavaScript framework for developing web applications (https://emberjs.com). It follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern and reduces the need for manual configuration and decision-making. Ember JS is used to increase the productivity and decrease the development duration of building a complex web application.
